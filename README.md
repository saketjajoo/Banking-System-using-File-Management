# Banking-System-using-File-Management

This is a project related to banking system using file management. The language used is C++. I've also tried to add some graphics to the project to make it somewhat more attractive...
I recommend you to run this project using Turbo C++ instead of CodeBlocks, DevC++, etc. as I feel that Turbo C++ is more powerful than any other compiler.
