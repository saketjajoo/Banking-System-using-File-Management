# Banking-System-using-File-Management

This is a project related to banking system using file management. The language used is C++. Also, some graphics is added to the project to make it somewhat more attractive...
It is recommended that this project should be executed on Turbo C++ instead of CodeBlocks, DevC++, etc. as Turbo C++ is more powerful than any other compiler and also, the visualization of the graphical part is much better in the output window of TurboC++ than CMD.
